    <h1>Adapted Physical Education (APE)</h1>

    <div>
        <p>
            Adapted Physical Education (APE) is specifically modified or adapted physical education to serve students with disabilities. 
            Physical Education for students with disabilities is defined as the development of physical and motor skills, fundamental motor 
            skills and patterns, and skills in aquatics, dance, and individual and group games and sports. APE teachers provide a variety of 
            services including planning, assessments of abilities and environments, evaluation of services, and advocating for students. Because 
            physical education for students with disabilities is a federally mandated component of special education services, APE is a direct service. 
            APE may be provided in a variety of settings such as General PE, small-group, one-on-one or hospital homebound as necessary. Teacher 
            qualifications include Health and PE certification, and Special Education certification.

            Teachers and paraprofessionals working in the ACHIEVE Program can utilize the website to facilitate physical activities adapted to fit 
            their students’ unique needs. Students within the program receive 1 hour of service per week, however, many teachers like to keep the same 
            daily schedule. This website will allow teachers to see what we are working on so they can reiterate movements, and terminology and give 
            the students an opportunity for purposeful play more than their “allotted” time. Students and their families can utilize the website to 
            participate in physical activities adapted to fit their students’ unique needs. Adapted physical education is meant to provide students with 
            lifelong skills and healthy habits. This website allows students and their families to continue creating healthy habits outside of the classroom.

    Each county partners with Special Olympics to allow students with disabilities to participate in a variety of sports and activities.

    <p>Often, Adapted PE Coaches match their units and lesson plans with in-season sports, so students have an opportunity to learn and master specific skills.
